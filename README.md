Task									| Time
----------------------------------------|-----------
Read 52539 chars by String				|1.040170 s
Read 52539 chars StringBuilder			|0.004548 s
Read 52539 chars by BufferedReader		|0.917914 s


						"Java is 

				  		so easy"
				  
				  
StringBuilder is Usain Bolt for this test because it read like 
"J"+"a"+"v"+"a"+" "+"i"+"s"+" "+"s"+"o"+" "+" "+"e"+"a"+"s"+"y" then complete to String.

BufferedReader is number two because it read like "Java is"+"Java is so easy".

String is king from below because it read like "J"+"Ja"+"Jav"+"Java" continue like this till the end so waste of time.
